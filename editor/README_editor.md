3. Provide instructions for loading the file

### Option 2: Manual Setup
1. Open `problem_editor.html` in your web browser
2. Click "Load JSON File" and select your `problems.json` file
3. Start editing!

## How to Use

### 1. **Loading Data**
- Click "üìÅ Load JSON File" button
- Select your JSON file (should have the structure like your `problems.json`)
- The interface will load all problems and display them in the sidebar

### 2. **Navigating Problems**
- Click on any problem in the left sidebar to select it
- The problem details will appear in the main editing panel
- Use the status indicators to see which problems are complete/incomplete

### 3. **Editing Problems**

#### Problem Text
- Click in the "Problem Text" textarea
- Edit the mathematical expressions and text as needed
- Changes are saved automatically

#### Answer Options
- Each answer option (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H) can be edited
- Click in the text field next to each option to modify
- Use the radio buttons to select the correct answer

#### Correct Answer
- Use the dropdown menu to select the correct answer
- Or use the radio buttons in the answer options section

#### Solution
- Write detailed solution steps in the "Solution" textarea
- Include mathematical work, explanations, and final answer

#### Difficulty Level
- Click "Easy", "Medium", or "Hard" buttons
- The selected difficulty will be highlighted

#### Topics
- Type a topic in the input field and press Enter (or click "Add")
- Click on topic tags to remove them

### 4. **Saving and Exporting**

#### Save Progress
- Click "üíæ Save Progress" to save current work to browser storage
- This provides a backup in case you close the browser

#### Export Data
- Click "üíæ Export JSON" to download the edited data
- The file will be named `problems_edited.json`
- This contains all your modifications

## Data Structure

The interface expects JSON files with this structure:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "total_problems": 15,
    "total_images": 2,
    "processed_at": "2025-07-31 15:20:38",
    "pages_processed": 7
  },
  "problems": [
    {
      "id": "math103_final_fall2014_p1",
      "problem_text": "The problem statement...",
      "answer_options": {
        "A": "Option A",
        "B": "Option B",
        "C": "Option C",
        "D": "Option D",
        "E": "Option E",
        "F": "Option F",
        "G": "Option G",
        "H": "Option H"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "solution": "Detailed solution steps...",
      "images": ["image1.png"],
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "topics": ["derivatives", "implicit_differentiation"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Problem Completion Criteria

A problem is considered "complete" when it has:
- ‚úÖ Problem text
- ‚úÖ Correct answer selected
- ‚úÖ Solution written
- ‚úÖ Difficulty level assigned
- ‚úÖ At least one topic tag

## Tips for Efficient Editing

1. **Use the sidebar**: Quickly navigate between problems using the sidebar
2. **Check status indicators**: Green checkmarks show complete problems, yellow warnings show incomplete ones
3. **Save frequently**: Use "Save Progress" to avoid losing work
4. **Export regularly**: Download your changes periodically
5. **Use topics consistently**: Create a standard set of topics for better organization

## Browser Compatibility

The interface works best in modern browsers:
- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Troubleshooting

### File won't load
- Make sure your JSON file has the correct structure
- Check that the file is valid JSON (no syntax errors)

### Changes not saving
- Use "Save Progress" to save to browser storage
- Use "Export JSON" to download the file
- Check browser console for any error messages

### Interface not working
- Try refreshing the page
- Clear browser cache and try again
- Check that JavaScript is enabled
