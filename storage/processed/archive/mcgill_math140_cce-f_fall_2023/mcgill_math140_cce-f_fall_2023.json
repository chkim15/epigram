EXAMINER: Dr. Dylan Cant SOLUTIONS Instructions - This exam has a total of 100 points and consists of two parts: - Part A is worth 50 points and consists of eleven multiple choice questions. Those questions must be answered on the bubble sheet on page 20 of the exam. You may detach that page for answering the questions. - Part B is worth 50 points and consists of five written questions, worth 10 marks each. Those questions must be answered directly on the exam. You may use the back pages for extra space. - This is a closed book examination. Calculators and smarter devices are forbidden. - Pages 17-19 are extra space for rough work. If you require them to be graded, you must indicate it very clearly in the question to which it relates, otherwise the graders will not look at them. No extra booklet will be allowed. - The exam will be scanned and graded on a computer (with Crowdmark). So please do not write anything over the QR code in the corner of any page, and write dark enough and not too close to the edge of the paper. - ! ) A parabola $ y=\\left(x-r_{1}\\right)\\left(x-r_{2}\\right) $ with roots $ r_{1}&lt;r_{2} $ is changing in such a way that the distance between the roots is growing at a constant speed of 1 unit per second. When the distance between the roots is 2 , what is the rate of change of the $ y $-coordinate of the vertex? Note: The vertex of a parabola $ y=(x-h)^{2}+k $ is the point $ (h, k) $. $ x $ coordinate of vertex is midpoint of roots, so $ x=\\left(r_{1}+r_{2}\\right) / 2 $. Plug in to formula to get $ y $-coordinate of vertex: $$ y_{\\mathrm{vertex}}=\\frac{1}{4}\\left(r_{2}-r_{1}\\right)\\left(r_{1}-r_{2}\\right) . $$ Let $ d=\\left(r_{2}-r_{1}\\right) $ be distance between roots, so: $$ y_{\\mathrm{vertex}}=-\\frac{d^{2}}{4} $$ Differentiate to get: $$ y_{\\mathrm{vertex}}^{\\prime}=-\\frac{2 d d^{\\prime}}{4}=-\\frac{2 d}{4} $$ When $$ d=2 $$ we get the final",
